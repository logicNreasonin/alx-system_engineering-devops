# Web Infrastructure Design

This project covers the design and understanding of web infrastructure systems, from simple single-server setups to complex distributed architectures.

## Project Overview

The goal is to design and explain various web infrastructure configurations, understanding the role of each component and identifying potential issues and solutions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How the web stack works
- The difference between a web server and an application server
- DNS records and their purposes
- Load balancers and their algorithms
- System redundancy and high availability concepts
- Common web infrastructure issues and solutions

## Requirements

### General
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Each task requires a whiteboard diagram (screenshot required)
- Manual review process with mentor/staff whiteboarding session
- Focus on requirements without unnecessary details
- All explanations must be in English

### Tasks Overview

**Task 0: Simple Web Stack**
- Design a single-server web infrastructure
- Components: 1 server, Nginx, application server, application files, MySQL database
- Domain: `www.foobar.com` pointing to IP `8.8.8.8`

## Infrastructure Components Explained

### What is a Server?
A server is a computer or software system that provides functionality or services to other programs or devices (clients). In web infrastructure, it's typically a physical or virtual machine that hosts websites and applications.

### Role of Domain Name
A domain name is a human-readable address that maps to an IP address. It allows users to access websites using memorable names (like `foobar.com`) instead of numeric IP addresses.

### DNS Record Types
- **A Record**: Maps a domain name directly to an IPv4 address
- **CNAME Record**: Maps a domain name to another domain name
- **www Record**: Typically a CNAME or A record that handles the www subdomain

### Web Server Role (Nginx)
- Handles HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients
- Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images)
- Acts as a reverse proxy to application servers
- Manages SSL/TLS termination
- Implements caching strategies

### Application Server Role
- Executes business logic and application code
- Processes dynamic content requests
- Communicates with databases and external services
- Generates dynamic web pages
- Handles user sessions and authentication

### Database Role (MySQL)
- Stores and manages application data
- Handles data persistence and retrieval
- Manages data relationships and integrity
- Provides query optimization and indexing
- Ensures data consistency and reliability

### Communication Protocol
The server communicates with user computers using:
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Application layer protocol for web communication
- **TCP/IP**: Transport and network layer protocols for reliable data transmission

## Common Infrastructure Issues

### SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
When a single component failure can bring down the entire system. In a single-server setup, if the server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

### Downtime During Maintenance
- Server restarts required for deployments
- Database maintenance windows
- Software updates requiring system reboots

### Scalability Limitations
- Limited server resources (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Single server cannot handle high traffic loads
- No horizontal scaling capabilities

## Tasks

### 0. Simple Web Stack
**File**: `0-simple_web_stack`

Design a one-server web infrastructure hosting `www.foobar.com`

**Components Required**:
- 1 server
- 1 web server (Nginx)
- 1 application server
- 1 set of application files
- 1 database (MySQL)
- 1 domain name configured with www record

**Issues to Address**:
- SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
- Downtime during maintenance
- Scaling limitations

## Repository Information

- **GitHub repository**: `alx-system_engineering-devops`
- **Directory**: `0x09-web_infrastructure_design`
- **Files**: Task-specific files (0-simple_web_stack, etc.)

## Whiteboarding Session Preparation

For the whiteboarding session, be prepared to:
1. Draw the infrastructure diagram from memory
2. Explain each component's role clearly
3. Discuss communication flow between components
4. Identify and explain infrastructure issues
5. Answer specific questions about DNS, servers, and protocols

## Best Practices

1. **Keep explanations concise and focused**
2. **Use proper technical terminology**
3. **Draw clear, labeled diagrams**
4. **Practice explaining concepts aloud**
5. **Understand the "why" behind each component**

## Resources

- Understanding DNS and domain names
- Web server vs application server differences
- Database management systems
- Network protocols (HTTP, TCP/IP)
- System architecture principles

**Remember**: Focus on the requirements and avoid unnecessary details. Practice explaining concepts clearly and concisely for your whiteboarding session.
